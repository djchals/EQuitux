EQuitux is a poker equity calculator for Linux under the GNU GPL license, and
has been developed in C/C++ and QT5. 

If you want to calculate a preflop situation, random boards will be analyzed 
until the Stop button is pressed. This is because the total number of boards 
is very large, and if all of them had to be analyzed, the operation would take 
too long.

In postflop situations all possible Turns/Rivers will be calculated.
